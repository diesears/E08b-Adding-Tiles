Hello! This is my work using the Godot program to create a basic 2D game. This game is similar to breakout and lets the player bounce a ball around the screen with a paddle. Destroy all the tiles and you win. Run the file to play the game. This code demonstrates the use of sprites and collision boxes to create a 2D game.
